     opts:["Market risk","Credit risk","Geopolitical risk","Operational risk"],ans:2,
     exp:"<strong>Geopolitical risk</strong> falls under 'other domains' (BCP-covered) — not a Basel regulatory target. The 4 Basel targets are ① market ② credit ③ operational ④ liquidity risk."},
    {cat:"Market Risk",
     q:"What are the 3 parameters that define a VaR measurement?",
     hint:"Think: how far back do you look, how long do you hold, and how confident are you?",
     opts:["Observation period, holding period, confidence level","Observation period, recovery rate, confidence level","PD, EAD, LGD","Holding period, credit rating, confidence level"],ans:0,
     exp:"<strong>Observation period</strong> (past data days), <strong>holding period</strong> (days held), and <strong>confidence level</strong> (e.g. 99%). Reading: VaR = ¥9B means only 1% chance of losing ¥9B+ over the holding period."},
    {cat:"Market Risk",
     q:"When interest rates rise, what happens to a fixed-rate bond you hold?",
     hint:"You hold a bond paying 2% coupon. Market rates move to 3%. How attractive is your bond now?",
     opts:["Its price rises","Its price falls","Its price stays the same","It depends only on duration"],ans:1,
     exp:"<strong>Interest rates ↑ → Bond prices ↓</strong> (inverse relationship). Higher market rates make existing low-coupon bonds less attractive — their market price falls to compensate."},
    {cat:"Market Risk",
     q:"Which description correctly defines GPS (Grid Point Sensitivity)?",
     hint:"There are 3 sensitivity methods — BPV, GPS, SPV. Each measures a different type of yield curve movement.",
     opts:["Shifts the entire yield curve in parallel to measure impact","Shifts only a specific maturity point to measure per-tenor risk","Measures steepening/flattening yield curve shape risk","Measures equity price sensitivity"],ans:1,
     exp:"<strong>GPS</strong> shifts only a specific maturity point locally — giving granular risk by tenor. BPV = parallel shift of the full curve. SPV = slope (steepening/flattening) change."},
    {cat:"Credit Risk",
     q:"Which formula correctly calculates Expected Loss (EL)?",
     opts:["EL = PD + EAD + LGD","EL = PD × EAD ÷ LGD","EL = PD × EAD × LGD","EL = (1 − PD) × EAD × LGD"],ans:2,
     exp:"<strong>EL = PD × EAD × LGD</strong>. Default probability × exposure at default × loss given default. This is the baseline credit risk metric — analogous to a loan loss provision."},

     hint:"If you have collateral covering 60%, how much do you actually lose?",
     opts:["1 + Recovery Rate","1 − Recovery Rate","Default probability × Recovery Rate","Exposure ÷ Collateral value"],ans:1,
     exp:"<strong>LGD = 1 − Recovery Rate</strong>. If collateral covers 60% → Recovery Rate = 60% → LGD = 40%. The type and coverage ratio of collateral determine LGD."},
    {cat:"Credit Risk",
     q:"Which best describes CVA (Credit Value Adjustment)?",
     hint:"Think of it as the equivalent of a loan loss provision, but applied to derivatives.",
     opts:["VaR methodology applied to credit risk","Present value of expected loss on OTC derivatives if the counterparty defaults","A liquidity metric complementing LCR","Additional capital surcharge imposed on G-SIBs"],ans:1,
     exp:"<strong>CVA</strong> is the present value of the expected loss from an OTC derivative counterparty defaulting — essentially the 'loan loss provision for derivatives'. Charging CVA to traders naturally discourages high-risk counterparties."},
    {cat:"Liquidity Risk",
     q:"Which formula correctly defines LCR?",
     opts:["HQLA ÷ 30-day net cash outflows ≥ 100%","Available stable funding ÷ required stable funding ≥ 100%","Own capital ÷ risk-weighted assets ≥ 8%","Risk-adjusted return ÷ economic capital"],ans:0,
     exp:"<strong>LCR = HQLA ÷ 30-day net cash outflows ≥ 100%</strong>. ② is NSFR, ③ is the Basel capital ratio, ④ is RAROC."},
    {cat:"Liquidity Risk",
     q:"Which HQLA level receives a 100% haircut (full value counted)?",
     hint:"Think about the safest, most liquid assets a bank can hold.",
     opts:["Investment-grade corporate bonds (A+)","Residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS, AA+)","Cash, central bank reserves, 0% risk-weight government bonds","Covered bonds (AA+)"],ans:2,
     exp:"<strong>Level 1 assets</strong> (cash, central bank reserves, 0% RW government bonds) qualify at 100%. Level 2A (corp bonds, covered bonds) = 85%. Level 2B (RMBS AA+) = 75%."},
    {cat:"Liquidity Risk",
     q:"What core problem does NSFR address?",
     opts:["Short-term (30-day) stress — insufficient liquid assets","Maturity mismatch: funding long-term assets with short-term debt, causing insolvency when rollover fails","Counterparty default loss on derivative contracts","Global bank capital adequacy shortfall"],ans:1,
     exp:"<strong>NSFR</strong> targets maturity mismatch. Classic failure: borrow 3-month money, lend for 2 years. In a crisis, the short-term rollover fails but the long-term loan can't be recalled → insolvency."},
    {cat:"Basel III",
     q:"Which capital tier was newly introduced in Basel III?",
     opts:["Tier 1 (common equity + preferred shares)","Tier 2 (subordinated debt, etc.)","CET1 — Common Equity Tier 1","TLAC — Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity"],ans:2,
     exp:"<strong>CET1 (Common Equity Tier 1)</strong> was introduced in Basel III — consisting solely of common shares and retained earnings. It is the highest-quality capital tier, with a minimum requirement of 4.5%."},
    {cat:"Basel III",
     q:"Which formula correctly defines RAROC?",
     opts:["(Revenue + Risk) ÷ Economic Capital","(Revenue − Risk) ÷ Economic Capital","Revenue ÷ (Economic Capital × Risk)","Risk × Revenue ÷ Own Capital"],ans:1,
     exp:"<strong>RAROC = (Revenue − Risk Cost) ÷ Economic Capital</strong>. Two units with the same revenue but different risk levels will have different RAROCs. Used to allocate capital to the most efficient business units."},
    {cat:"Basel III",
     q:"What are the 3 denominator components of the Basel II capital ratio?",
     opts:["Market risk + credit risk + geopolitical risk","Credit risk + op risk + liquidity risk","Credit risk + market risk + operational risk","Market risk + liquidity risk + reputational risk"],ans:2,
     exp:"Basel II: Capital Ratio = Own Capital ÷ (<strong>Credit risk + Market risk + Operational risk</strong>) ≥ 8%. Basel III then added LCR, NSFR, leverage ratio, and various capital buffers on top."},
    {cat:"Securities Systems",
     q:"How did TSE ArrowHead (launched 2010) change order processing time?",
     opts:["5 seconds → 1 second","3 seconds → 10 milliseconds","1 second → 100 microseconds","10 seconds → 1 millisecond"],ans:1,
     exp:"<strong>ArrowHead</strong> reduced order processing from 3 seconds to <strong>10 milliseconds</strong>. Market data tick capacity also grew from 600 to 8,200 ticks/sec (~13.5×). Co-location services were introduced."},

     exp:"<strong>'Default the dangerous action to Cancel.'</strong> Confirmation dialogs should focus the Cancel button, not Confirm — so an accidental Enter key press triggers cancellation, not execution. ¥40.4B in losses led to a ¥10.7B Supreme Court settlement against TSE."},

     opts:["A code review tool with AI suggestions","An agentic CLI that autonomously plans, executes, and self-corrects — not just autocomplete","A chat interface for asking coding questions","An IDE extension for syntax highlighting"],ans:1,
     exp:"<strong>Claude Code</strong> is an <strong>agentic CLI</strong> — it runs a full Read-Eval-Print Loop to complete multi-step tasks autonomously. GitHub Copilot is low-autonomy autocomplete; Claude Code can write, test, fix, and commit in one workflow."},

     q:"What does REPL stand for in the context of Claude Code's execution model?",
     opts:["Remote Execution and Programming Layer","Read-Eval-Print Loop","Recursive Error Prevention Logic","Real-time Execution Planning Language"],ans:1,
     exp:"<strong>REPL = Read-Eval-Print Loop</strong>. In Claude Code: Plan → Execute (tool call) → Observe (output) → loop until goal met → final human review. This loop can run dozens of iterations autonomously."},
    {cat:"Claude Code",
     q:"What is CLAUDE.md and what is it used for?",
     opts:["A markdown viewer built into Claude Code","A project-level instruction file that Claude Code reads on startup for project-specific context","A log file where Claude Code records completed actions","A configuration file for API authentication"],ans:1,
     exp:"<strong>CLAUDE.md</strong> is a project-level instruction file placed in the repo. Claude Code reads it on every session startup — defining repo structure, coding conventions, and workflows. Like a senior engineer's onboarding doc, written once, reused forever."},
    {cat:"Safety",
     q:"What is Prompt Injection and how does Claude Code defend against it?",
     opts:["Overly long prompts that cause token overflow — defended by context compression","Malicious instructions hidden in tool outputs (files, web pages) designed to hijack the agent — defended by an injection scanner layer","SQL injection adapted for LLMs — defended by input sanitization","Social engineering in the chat interface — defended by rate limiting"],ans:1,
     exp:"<strong>Prompt Injection</strong>: malicious text in observed content (a webpage, a file) that tries to re-direct the agent's actions. Claude Code scans all tool outputs for such instructions before processing them — a dedicated defense layer."},
    {cat:"12-Factor",
     q:"What is 'The Dumb Zone' in 12-Factor Agent terminology?",
     opts:["A warning logged when the agent calls an undefined tool","The performance degradation that occurs when context window fills beyond 40–50%","The period after context compaction when memory is reset","A quadrant chart zone for low-reliability, low-autonomy agents"],ans:1,
     exp:"<strong>The Dumb Zone</strong>: research showed LLM instruction-following drops exponentially when context window exceeds 40–50% full. Factor 5 mandates active context curation — using RAG and summarization to keep the 'active' context lean."},
    {cat:"12-Factor",
     q:"Factor 3 of the 12-Factor Agents states: 'Own Your Control Flow'. What does this mean?",
     opts:["The LLM should decide all branching logic autonomously","Use deterministic code (Python/TypeScript) for the main agent loop, not the LLM","All agent decisions must be logged to a control-flow database","Human operators should manually approve every step"],ans:1,
     exp:"<strong>Factor 3 — Own Your Control Flow</strong>: the main agent loop (branching, retries, error handling) should be written in deterministic code, not delegated to the LLM. The LLM handles reasoning and tool calls; your code handles the scaffolding."},
    {cat:"12-Factor",
     q:"In a 12-Factor Agent system, how is Human-in-the-Loop (Factor 8) implemented?",
     opts:["A separate web dashboard where humans approve batches of actions","'Ask a human' is implemented as a standard tool call that pauses execution","Humans manually review and replay all agent logs daily","A flag in the config file that enables human review mode"],ans:1,
     exp:"<strong>Factor 8</strong>: treat 'ask a human' as a standard tool call. The agent calls <code>request_human_intervention()</code> when it recognizes uncertainty, pausing execution state (Factor 7) until a human provides guidance or approval, then resuming."},
    {cat:"Vibe Coding",
     q:"What are the two key technical breakthroughs that made Vibe Coding possible?",
     opts:["Faster CPUs and cheaper cloud storage","Massive context windows (hundreds of thousands of tokens) and MCP standardization","Improved code editors and Git workflow automation","Lower API costs and open-source model releases"],ans:1,
     exp:"Vibe Coding requires <strong>massive context windows</strong> (Claude 3.5 = 200k tokens, enabling AI to 'read' an entire project) and <strong>MCP (Model Context Protocol)</strong>, which standardizes how AI agents connect to local files, databases, and APIs — grounding the AI in your actual codebase."},
    {cat:"Vibe Coding",
     q:"What is 'Context Rot' in Vibe Coding?",
     opts:["When the AI's training data becomes outdated","Hallucinations caused by stale or poorly managed context that breaks existing code patterns","The accumulation of commented-out code in AI-generated files","Token budget exhaustion during a long session"],ans:1,
     exp:"<strong>Context Rot</strong>: if the AI's context isn't actively managed (wrong files loaded, old summaries, conflicting instructions), it starts 'hallucinating' solutions that break existing patterns or contradict earlier decisions. Prevented by good CLAUDE.md and regular /compact."},
    {cat:"Claude Code",
     q:"What does Claude Code's 5-layer context compressor achieve?",
     opts:["Reduces file size of generated code","Encrypts session state for security","Reduces token costs by up to 90% by summarizing and caching older context","Compresses images in the codebase"],ans:2,
     exp:"Claude Code's <strong>5-layer context compressor</strong> combined with prompt caching can reduce token costs by up to 90%. Older context is summarized and stored in SQLite (not dropped) so it can be recalled without consuming active context window space."},
    {cat:"12-Factor",
     q:"Factor 12 describes the 'Stateless Reducer Mindset'. What is the correct mental model?",
     opts:["Agents should not store any state between runs","Agent = pure function: (State + Input) → (New State + Output) — like a database transaction","Agents should reduce context size on each loop iteration","Only stateless HTTP calls should be used for tool interactions"],ans:1,
     exp:"<strong>Factor 12 — Stateless Reducer Mindset</strong>: think of the agent as a pure function — given the same (State + Input), it should produce the same (New State + Output). This makes agents testable, predictable, and resumable after failures — like a database transaction log."},
    {cat:"Claude Code",
     q:"What is the purpose of spawning subagents in Claude Code?",
     opts:["To run on separate machines for distributed computing","To handle parallel tasks simultaneously — e.g., searching docs while refactoring code","To create isolated security sandboxes for untrusted code","To reduce costs by using smaller models for simpler tasks"],ans:1,
     exp:"<strong>Subagents</strong> in Claude Code are specialized worker agents spawned for parallel tasks. Example: one subagent searches documentation, another refactors code, a third runs tests — all simultaneously. This mirrors the agentic 'swarm' pattern in Software 3.0."},

All systems depend on ⑤ Master Data (single source of truth) and ⑥ External Connectivity (exchange/clearing pipes)."},
    {cat:"Front vs. Back",
     q:"Why do back-office systems at securities firms still predominantly use mainframes?",
     opts:["Regulatory requirement mandates legacy technology","Mainframes offer unmatched reliability and batch processing throughput for settlement — intentional, not legacy debt","The cost of migration is too high","Front-office systems also use mainframes for consistency"],ans:1,
     exp:"<strong>Back-office mainframes are intentional</strong>: they provide unmatched reliability, throughput, and auditability for settlement batch processing. NRI STAR series and Broadridge Gloss dominate. 'If it ain\'t broke, don\'t fix it' — stability trumps modernity in settlement."},
    {cat:"Settlement",
     q:"What does DVP (Delivery versus Payment) eliminate and how?",
     opts:["It eliminates counterparty credit risk by requiring credit checks","It eliminates settlement risk by making securities delivery and cash payment simultaneous and atomic","It eliminates operational risk by automating all settlement instructions","It eliminates market risk by fixing exchange rates at trade time"],ans:1,
     exp:"<strong>DVP (Delivery versus Payment)</strong> makes securities delivery and cash payment <em>atomic</em> — they happen simultaneously or not at all. This eliminates principal risk: you can never deliver securities without simultaneously receiving payment."},
    {cat:"Settlement",
     q:"What is STP (Straight-Through Processing) in a securities context?",
     opts:["A technology for real-time stock price streaming","Automated end-to-end trade lifecycle processing from execution to settlement with zero manual intervention","A risk management protocol for cross-border trades","A settlement timing standard (T+2)"],ans:1,
     exp:"<strong>STP (Straight-Through Processing)</strong>: automated processing from trade execution through to settlement without any manual touchpoints. Every manual step = a potential error, delay, or fraud vector. Full STP means the entire trade lifecycle runs without human intervention."},
    {cat:"Settlement",
     q:"What role does JSCC (Japan Securities Clearing Corporation) play in the settlement process?",
     opts:["Holds securities in book-entry form on behalf of participants","Acts as central counterparty via novation — becomes buyer to every seller and seller to every buyer","Connects exchanges to broker-dealers via FIX protocol","Manages the master data for all listed securities"],ans:1,
     exp:"<strong>JSCC</strong> is the central counterparty clearing house. Through <strong>novation</strong>, it inserts itself as the buyer to every seller and seller to every buyer — so participants face JSCC's credit risk, not each other's. This dramatically reduces bilateral credit exposure."},
    {cat:"Risk",
     q:"What is Settlement Risk and how does it differ from Credit Risk?",
     opts:["They are the same risk — both relate to counterparty default","Settlement Risk is the risk that settlement fails due to technical/operational failure, even if both parties are creditworthy","Settlement Risk is only present in bond markets, not equities","Settlement Risk means a counterparty can't pay due to insolvency"],ans:1,
     exp:"<strong>Settlement Risk</strong> is distinct: even a creditworthy counterparty can fail to settle due to system outages, incorrect instructions, or processing errors. A failed settlement can trigger cascading failures across the market. DVP and STP address this. Credit Risk addresses default."},
    {cat:"J-COM Incident",
     q:"What were the two contributing factors to the J-COM misorder incident (2005)?",
     opts:["Regulatory gap and market manipulation","Human input error AND a TSE system bug that prevented cancellation after execution began","Server outage and network failure at Mizuho Securities","Algorithmic trading runaway and insufficient circuit breakers"],ans:1,

Two failures: ① human entry error and ② TSE cancellation system bug that allowed execution despite cancellation requests. ¥40B loss; Supreme Court ordered TSE to pay ¥10.7B compensation."},
    {cat:"Flash Crash",
     q:"What was the primary lesson from the Flash Crash (2010) for algorithmic trading regulation?",
     opts:["All algorithmic trading should be banned in equities markets","Algorithms must be circuit-breaker equipped; automatic trading halts needed to prevent runaway algo feedback loops","Exchanges must increase tick size to slow down HFT","Human approval required for orders above 1,000 shares"],ans:1,
     exp:"<strong>Flash Crash (May 2010)</strong>: one large mutual fund sell order triggered a cascade of algo stop-losses, dropping the Dow 1,000 points in minutes. Lesson: algo feedback loops can amplify moves catastrophically. <strong>Circuit breakers</strong> (automatic trading halts at threshold moves) were mandated globally."},
    {cat:"ArrowHead",
     q:"What performance improvement did TSE ArrowHead (2010) deliver for order entry?",
     opts:["10 seconds → 1 second (10× faster)","3 seconds → 10 milliseconds (300× faster)","1 second → 100 microseconds (10,000× faster)","500ms → 1ms (500× faster)"],ans:1,
     exp:"<strong>TSE ArrowHead</strong> (2010): order entry improved from 3 seconds to <strong>10 milliseconds — a 300× improvement</strong>. Quote distribution grew from 600 to 8,200 ticks/second (~13.5×). This made co-location essential and transformed the competitive landscape for HFT."},
    {cat:"Systems Architecture",
     q:"Which back-office vendor is associated with Accenture in the Japan securities post-trade market?",

     q:"What does JASDEC do in the Japanese securities settlement ecosystem?",
     opts:["Clears and novates equity trades as central counterparty","Acts as central securities depository — holds securities in book-entry form and runs settlement","Manages market surveillance and regulatory reporting","Operates the TSE matching engine"],ans:1,
     exp:"<strong>JASDEC (Japan Securities Depository Center)</strong> is Japan's central securities depository (CSD). It holds all listed securities in book-entry (dematerialized) form on behalf of participants, and runs the actual securities settlement process. JSCC = clearing; JASDEC = custody & settlement."},

     q:"A short seller holds a borrowed position and the stock pays a dividend. What happens?",
     opts:["The short seller receives the dividend","The dividend is cancelled","The short seller must pay the dividend to the stock lender","No adjustment — dividends don't affect short positions"],ans:2,
     exp:"Short selling means you borrowed someone else's shares. The original owner retains the right to dividends — so the short seller must <strong>compensate the lender</strong> out of pocket, adding to the cost of maintaining the position."},

     q:"Implied Volatility (IV) vs Historical Volatility (HV) — which one is forward-looking?",
     opts:["Historical Volatility","Implied Volatility","GARCH","EWMA"],ans:1,
     exp:"<strong>Implied Volatility</strong> is back-calculated from current option market prices. Because options are priced by what investors expect to happen, IV reflects the market's consensus forecast of <em>future</em> uncertainty — not past data."},

     q:"Which model captures volatility clustering — the empirical tendency for rough markets to stay rough?",
     opts:["Black-Scholes","CAPM","GARCH","Duration"],ans:2,
     exp:"<strong>GARCH</strong> (Generalised Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) explicitly models the fact that large shocks tend to be followed by more large shocks. The variance equation includes both last period's shock and last period's variance."},

     q:"What does Convexity correct for in bond pricing that Modified Duration cannot?",
     opts:["Credit risk","The curvature of the price-yield relationship for large rate moves","Daily time decay","Dividend payments"],ans:1,
     exp:"<strong>Duration</strong> is a linear (first-order) approximation. For large yield changes, the actual price-yield curve is curved (convex), not straight. <strong>Convexity</strong> is the second-order Taylor expansion term that corrects for this curvature."},

     q:"Delta hedging a portfolio means keeping Delta near zero. What Greek measures how quickly Delta itself changes?",
     opts:["Vega","Theta","Gamma","Rho"],ans:2,
     exp:"<strong>Gamma (Γ)</strong> is the second derivative of option price with respect to the underlying — i.e. the rate of change of Delta. A high-Gamma position requires frequent rehedging because Delta shifts rapidly as the underlying moves."},

     q:"Why did SVB (Silicon Valley Bank) collapse in March 2023?",
     opts:["It had excessive exposure to crypto assets","The Fed's rate hikes caused the MTM value of its large treasury/bond holdings to collapse, creating a bank run","It was fined for money laundering violations","It lost on speculative FX positions"],ans:1,
     exp:"SVB was long duration — it held a large portfolio of long-term treasuries and MBS. When the Fed hiked rates aggressively, <strong>bond prices fell sharply</strong>, creating massive unrealised (MTM) losses. When depositors learned of these losses, a bank run ensued."},
    {cat:"Macro",
     q:"What is an Inverted Yield Curve and why is it watched as a recession signal?",
     opts:["Short-term rates fall below long-term rates — indicates economic expansion","Short-term rates exceed long-term rates — historically precedes recessions by 6–24 months","The yield curve flattens perfectly — neutral signal","Long-term rates spike above 10% — indicates hyperinflation"],ans:1,
     exp:"An <strong>inverted yield curve</strong> (short > long rates) occurs when central banks hike short-term rates aggressively (e.g. to fight inflation). Markets interpret this as policy overtightening that will eventually cause a slowdown — making it a reliable leading recession indicator."},
    {cat:"Macro",
     q:"Japan's YCC (Yield Curve Control) pegged the 10-year JGB near 0% while US rates reached 5.25%. What exchange-rate consequence followed?",
     opts:["The yen strengthened dramatically against the dollar","USD/JPY pushed toward 160 as carry traders borrowed yen to buy US assets","The Japanese yen was officially pegged to the dollar","Japan raised rates faster than the US, causing yen appreciation"],ans:1,
     exp:"<strong>Interest rate parity</strong> (E[Δe] ≈ i_US − i_JP) predicts that a large rate differential drives the lower-rate currency weaker. With a ~525 bps spread, carry traders borrowed in cheap yen and invested in US assets, driving USD/JPY to historic highs near 160."},
    {cat:"History",
     q:"The world's first derivatives exchange (Dojima Rice Exchange, Osaka 1730) pioneered a settlement method still used in modern futures. What was it?",
     opts:["Physical delivery only","Cash settlement (差金決済) — only the price difference changes hands","Government-guaranteed settlement","Bilateral OTC settlement"],ans:1,
     exp:"<strong>Cash settlement</strong> (差金決済) means only the monetary difference between the agreed price and the market price is exchanged — no physical rice needed to move. This innovation eliminated costly logistics and is the foundation of modern derivatives settlement."},
